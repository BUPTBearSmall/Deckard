There are precompiled binaries for i386 in bin/.
To compile, type make.
This generates several binaries in bin/, we care only about enumBuckets.
If trouble, try changing DEFINE_FLOAT in sources/Makefile.
There is a lot of garbage from Andoni and Indyk's code :-)
To generate a time-stamped archive, type make arch.

My contribution is in sources/enumBuckets.cpp (which is a modified copy of
sources/LSHMain.cpp) + some changes in headers + Makefiles.

Usage of the binary: enumBuckets <options>

-A		output all clones, ignoring all filtering parameters except for lowerBound
-B		output all clones, ignoring the filtering parameters for bug reports;
		used for clone detections.
-l <N>		minimum number of lines for a vector to be reported
-b <N>		minimum number of vectors for a bucket to be reported
-F		inter-file clone detection.
======TODO options=====
-V <N>		maximum number of different nVARs for a bucket to be reported
-e <R>		maximum diff among the number of different nVARs for a bucket to be reported
-E <R>		maximum diff among nVARs for a bucket to be reported.
=======================

-v <N>          minimum nVARS for an item to be reported
-m <N>		minimum NUM_NODES for a vector to be reported
-t <N>		maximum number of vectors for a bucket to be reported
-N <N>		number of points (automatically detected)
-d <N>		dimension (automatically detected)
-p <file>	parameter file name (will be created if needed)
-P <R>		probability of success (LSH parameter)
-M <N>		available memory (default: 800000000)
-a <N>		read <N> lines at once (prefetch parameter)
-c		forces parameters to be recomputed
-R <R>		radius parameter of the LSH algorithm
-f <file>	input file

<N> is a positive integer, <R> a floating-point value, <file> a filename

It may be interesting to run it through the command time.
Results are printed to stdout, error and warnings are printed to stderr.

Typical use:
time bin/enumBuckets -p gcc.params -f gcc.vector -R 0.9 > gcc.result
